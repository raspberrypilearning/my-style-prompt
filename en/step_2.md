## Prompting ChatGPT

This series of prompts will allow you to paste in copies of your preivous writing, and create an output which can be used as instructions for ChatGPT.

--- task ---

Open [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/).

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Copy and paste the following text into the Prompt bar at the bottom of the screen:
`I'd like your help in creating articles for my job, including blog posts, emails and magazine articles. Your first task will be to understand my writing style based on examples that I give you. After that, we'll create some content.` 
`To start, say “Please paste training documents now!” and I will paste examples of my writing for you to analyse. Keep saying “Please paste training documents now!” and I will paste new examples until I am satisfied. Do not reply anything else until I tell you I am finished entering training documents.`
`When I am done entering training documents, I will say FINISHED. At this stage, do not do anything except confirm that you have saved the writing style.`

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Press **Enter**. ChatGPT should say `Please paste training documents now!`

--- /task ---

Training documents could be anything - emails, articles, reports, anything you think makes a good example of 'training data' for ChatGPT. It might be more valuable to you to repeat this process for each of the different voices you use in your work. 

For example:
If you add examples of your writing exclusively from your articles, ChatGPT will mimic this voice incredibly closely. If you add emails, it will sound the way you do in your email conversations. 

--- task ---

Paste in examples of your writing, one at a time. Press **Enter** after each example. Keep pasting in examples until you are satisfied that you've captured a good cross-section of your writing in that style.   

--- /task ---

--- task ---

When you are satisifed, type `FINISHED` and press Enter. ChatGPT will say something confirmational.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Paste in the following prompt:
`Using the training documents I have pasted in, analyse the style of my writing. Pay particular attention to the tone, voice, vocabulary and sentence structure of the writing. Provide a series of descriptive bullet points which summarise my writing style clearly and completely.`

Press **Enter**. ChatGPT will output a series of bullet points which describe your writing style.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Copy and paste this bulleted list into a google doc or other text file and save it as ‘My Style’. Now you can use it as the voice of ChatGPT whenever you like by pasting it into ChatGPT as a prompt!

--- /task ---

The output from ChatGPT can then be used to write emails using this as instructions and will sound like you for the duration of this chat, replying in your voice to any input:

--- task ---

Paste in the following prompt:
`Excellent! This summary is now called ‘My Style’. When you reply from now on, always reply in ‘My Style’. Do not reply with any other voice or style.`

--- /task ---

You can even get ChatGPT to condense the ‘My Style’ summary down into a short version to use as ‘Custom Instructions’ so that this voice is used in all new chats:

--- task ---

Paste in the following prompt:
`Condense the summary of my style into less than 1500 characters for use as ChatGPT Custom Instructions. Do not leave line breaks between sentences and use only simple punctuation. Capture all important and pertinent points from the summary. Do not reply with more than a total of 1500 characters.`

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Now open the ‘custom instructions’ window in ChatGPT by clicking the three dot menu at the bottom left, and paste in your condensed summary.
